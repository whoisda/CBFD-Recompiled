// Gyro and mouse aiming in the look mode (hold R, look around with the stick), and a choice of
// smooth or direct response for each of the stick, the mouse and gyro.
//
// func_15120158 runs the look mode once a frame. The stick moves a target yaw and pitch, in
// degrees ($t0 + 0x34 and + 0x38; yaw grows to the left and isn't wrapped), then the pitch target
// is clamped to limits that depend on what Conker is doing (0x15120B44 to 0x15120D28), and then a
// spring (func_15049688) eases the current angles ($s0 + 0x37C yaw, $t0 + 0x3C pitch) toward the
// targets, keeping their velocities in $t0 + 0x18 and + 0x1C. Everything the camera is built from
// is copied from the current angles after that.
//
// Hooks (conker.toml):
//   conker_look_stick_yaw_a/_b and conker_look_stick_pitch, where the stick's turn is stored into
//     the targets (0x15120A14, 0x15120A44, 0x15120A98): each can turn its axis around. The game's
//     stick has X normal and Y inverted (up looks down).
//   conker_look_targets, before the clamp: the mouse and gyro turn the targets, so the game's own
//     limits apply to them just as they do to the stick.
//   conker_look_currents, after the springs (L_15120E8C, where both of their branches meet): for
//     an input set to Direct, the current angles take its movement in the same frame instead of
//     being eased toward it.
//   conker_look_yaw_from_facing(_scaled), where some states work the yaw target out each frame from
//     Conker's facing less an aiming angle the stick turns: the mouse and gyro turn that angle too.
//   conker_aim_stick, in the second aiming mode (func_15126378: the sniper scope, the magnum,
//     throwables): the stick's invert, and the mouse and gyro, scaled by the zoom.
// The mouse and gyro are player 1's only: in multiplayer both modes run for each player's camera.
