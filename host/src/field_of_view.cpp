// Camera: Field of View (General tab, issue #65): widens or narrows the normal third-person
// camera's view, since with Right Stick: Free Camera the stick no longer zooms.
//
// func_1510B128 sets a camera's field of view each frame (D_800BE628, 0x180-byte cameras): the
// horizontal one in use (+0x74) and the vertical (+0x78), from the base ones (+0x6C, +0x70) plus
// its zoom and a global offset (D_800C3648). It then works out the projection (func_1510B5F8)
// and more from them, and the frustum the world is culled against (func_1501B22C) and the sky's
// sectors (widescreen.cpp) read them later. conker.toml calls conker_field_of_view just after
// both are stored: both are widened there by as much as the setting's vertical field of view is
// wider than the camera's base one (+0x70, 50 degrees; the horizontal base is 60.6 at 4:3), so
// the game's own zooming carries on around it, and everything after follows. The setting is the
// vertical field of view as it stays the same whatever the window's aspect ratio.
//
// The one other thing that depends on them is the scale the level's culls compare view-space
// x and y with (updateCullScales_1510B958): the game moves it linearly with the field of view,
// close enough for its own zooms but not for a much wider view, where the level's pieces at the
// sides were culled while in view. So at its return, with the setting in use, it's worked out
// from the game's own field of view instead, divided by how much wider the view is
// (conker::field_of_view::adjust_cull_scales, before widescreen.cpp widens it for the window).
//
// Only player 1's camera (index 0) in the normal camera (where the C-buttons turn it: not
// R-Look, aiming, cutscenes or other special cameras, so the scope's zoom and cutscenes' framing
// are the game's). Changing between them eases the change over a few frames.
